# BoostDistCopReg_Surv
Repository for functions and code to reproduce simulation study and application of Boosting Distributional Copula Regression for Right-Censored Time-to-Event Data.

Additionally, the wrapper function SurvCopBoost, which fits the proposed boosting distributional copula regression model for bivariate time-to-event data with right-censoring, is hosted here.
